<!-- <div class="content_title"> Description </div> -->
This game was made working in a 4 people team during my MSc. The team was very diverse with different skills and levels of experience. This made the development experience very enriched because we had to continually organize ourselves using Scrum methodology with Trello and helping each other to achieve our goals.

We created a Game Design Document (GDD). This document describes all game information. Things such as the mechanics, the objectives, level design, concept art,Â  UI but also its business model, monetization, planification and costs between others.

The story of the game is based in a dystopic future where beer is forbidden and our main character, a space pirate, is the only one who delivers beer all around the universe.

We thought that it would be a great idea that the beer that is in the game to be a real-world beer so we started reaching out to different beer companies to get a sponsorship. One crafted beer company was very interested. However, due to different opinions inside the team, a sponsorship couldn't be made.

I really enjoyed working on this project because of all the experience I gained working with a team and because this project was close to getting a sponsorship which could have been a great achievement.
