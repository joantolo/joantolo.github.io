title: "MY STORY"
---
Hello there!<br />
I'm Joan, a software engineer with a background in multimedia engineering and computer graphics 🤓.

My academic journey took me from Valencia, where I completed my degree in multimedia engineering, to Madrid 🚗 where I earned an MSc in computer graphics, virtual reality, and games with honors. My master's thesis was later published as an academic paper 🏅.

I actively contribute to open-source projects and constantly seek to expand my knowledge in system programming and Linux technologies 👨‍💻. My technical interests cover computer graphics, real-time simulations and desktop environments.

I'm also very interested in cooking 👨‍🍳 and doing sports. And I love practicing meditation to be more aware of the present moment 🧘‍♂️.
