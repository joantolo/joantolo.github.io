title: "MY STORY"
---
Hello there!<br />
I'm Joan. I was born and raised in Alicante in a loving and caring environment 🥰. While I was studying in high school I enrolled a rowing club and won some national championships 🚣.

I moved to Valencia to study a degree in multimedia engineering. Then I discovered the awesome world of programming 🖥 and I became very interested in the computer graphics field 🤓.

When I finished my degree I went to Madrid 🚗 to expand my knowledge in the computer graphics field studying a MSc in computer graphics, virtual reality and games. I had a lot of fun and when I finished my final thesis (with honors) it ended beeing a paper 🏅.

I'm also very interested in cooking 👨‍🍳 and doing sports. And I love practicing meditation to be more aware of the present moment 🧘‍♂️.
